1.  Jump search - In this search what happens is that you jump from intervals to intervals and look whether A[interval -1 ] < element < A[interval]
if that is true than we search linearly in that interval. For optimal interval value is we look at that worst case of the algorithm .
The Worst case happens when that element lies in the end of the array. So if the size of array is N and interval size is M. the worst case
iteration possible will be (N/M +M -1). so F(y) = N/M +M -1 . Now it is pure mathematical problem to find the minima of the function. 
By finding the double derrivative and check if its positve and then derrivative of function equating to zero will be global minima of the function.
in this case that is dy/dm = ((-N + M.dN/dM)/M^2) + 1 -0  ==> since N is const. dN/dM = 0 . ==> N/M^2 = 1  ==> M = sqrt(N)
therefore m optimal will be sqrt(N).
