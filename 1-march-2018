1.  Jump search - 

In this search what happens is that you jump from intervals to intervals and look whether A[interval -1 ] < element < A[interval]
if that is true than we search linearly in that interval. For optimal interval value is we look at that worst case of the algorithm .
The Worst case happens when that element lies in the end of the array. So if the size of array is N and interval size is M. the worst case
iteration possible will be (N/M +M -1). so F(y) = N/M +M -1 . Now it is pure mathematical problem to find the minima of the function. 
By finding the double derrivative and check if its positve and then derrivative of function equating to zero will be global minima of the function.
in this case that is dy/dm = ((-N + M.dN/dM)/M^2) + 1 -0  ==> since N is const. dN/dM = 0 . ==> N/M^2 = 1  ==> M = sqrt(N)
therefore m optimal will be sqrt(N).
It will be used on sorted array and has time complexity of o(sqrt(N)).
Binary Search is better than Jump Search, but Jump search has an advantage that we traverse back only once 
(Binary Search may require up to O(Log n) jumps, consider a situation where the element to be search is the smallest element or smaller 
than the smallest). So in a systems where jumping back is costly, we use Jump Search.

2.  Interpolation Search -
This search presumes that array is sorted and data is kuniformly distributed and so the the uniform properties of statistics will be applicable 
and as we know the uniform distribution generates a bell shaped curve. Now we know that cummulative distribution function of uniform distribution
 = (x - A[lo])/(A[hi] - A[lo]). this is the probability of finding x in the region [a,b) . so the position of mid will be 
 lo +(x - A[lo])*(hi -lo)/(A[hi] - A[lo]). In this way it improvises the bnary search and able to search element in o(loglog(n)) time complexity.
 
 3. Exponential Search -
 This search is similar of Jump search . here we increase the range by twice or exponentially and then we search the range using binary searcj
 .This method is very useful in unbounded search. We cannot use Jump,Interpolation or binary search there because they need the last element
 or the size of the array. It has o(log(n)) time complexity
